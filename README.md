Babysitter Kata exercise.

The Kata was built using Gradle, with test driven principles. 

1. Install Gradle: https://gradle.org/install/#manually
2. Verify your Gradle install by running 'gradle' from the command line or bash terminal.
3. Create a folder for your project.
4. Download the build.gradle from here, put it in your project folder: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WeCanCodeIT/gradle-scripts/master/basic-junit/build.gradle
5. Run 'gradle eclipse' from your project folder. This will set up Eclipse project as well as creating your folder structure. 
6. Import your project into Eclipse.

Step 4 is being provided by Brian Forsythe, friend and mentor.
